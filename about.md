# About The Artist
---

Video and sound artist, part time animator, web developer, and graphic designer.
Neverending passion for BUILDING and CREATING worlds, experience, emotions, and memories.


I have been creating art since as long as I can remember, starting with drawing and slowly moving to several other mediums. Currently, I am most interested in the intersection of technology and art, and the effects on the human mind. I hope to become a UI/UX Designer, Front-End Developer, or Full-Time Artist one day.
